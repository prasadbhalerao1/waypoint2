## Overview
This document summarizes all the improvements and features implemented in the WayPoint mental health platform.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Quick Check Feature**

#### What Was Implemented:
- **Adaptive Mental Health Check-In**: Created a comprehensive AI-powered Quick Check system that conducts ~10 adaptive questions based on user responses
- **Structured Output**: Implemented JSON schema-based structured output for consistent, parseable results
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic risk level assessment (low/moderate/high) based on responses
- **Safety Protocol**: Built-in crisis detection and escalation procedures

#### Files Created/Modified:
- **Backend:**
  - `server/QUICK_CHECK_PROMPT.txt` - Comprehensive prompt template for AI
  - `server/src/controllers/quickCheckController.js` - Controller handling Quick Check logic
  - `server/src/routes/quickCheck.js` - API routes for Quick Check
  - `server/src/index.js` - Added Quick Check routes to main server

- **Frontend:**
  - `Frontend/src/components/QuickCheckModal.tsx` - Beautiful modal UI for Quick Check
  - `Frontend/src/pages/Chat.tsx` - Integrated Quick Check modal
  - `Frontend/src/mockApi.ts` - Added Quick Check API endpoints
  - `Frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts` - Added Quick Check methods

#### How It Works:
1. User clicks "Quick Check" button in chat
2. Modal opens with first question from AI
3. User answers each question, AI adapts next question based on response
4. After ~10 questions, AI provides:
   - Summary of user's mental state
   - Risk level assessment
   - Personalized next steps
   - Crisis resources if needed
   - Readiness score for taking action

#### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/quick-check/start` - Start new Quick Check session
- `POST /api/v1/quick-check/answer` - Submit answer and get next question or final result
- `GET /api/v1/quick-check/history` - Get user's Quick Check history (future feature)

### 2. **Admin Dashboard Access Control**

#### What Was Implemented:
- **Email-Based Authorization**: Restricted admin dashboard access to specific email addresses
- **Whitelist System**: Only `prasad9a38@gmail.com` and `waypointplatform@gmail.com` can access admin features
- **Clerk Integration**: Verifies user email through Clerk authentication

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `server/src/middleware/adminAuth.js` - Admin authorization middleware
- `server/src/routes/admin.js` - Updated to use admin middleware

#### How It Works:
1. User attempts to access admin routes
2. Middleware checks if user is authenticated via Clerk
3. Fetches user's primary email from Clerk
4. Compares against whitelist
5. Grants or denies access accordingly

#### Security Features:
- Logs unauthorized access attempts
- Returns 403 Forbidden for non-admin users
- Validates email at every admin route request

---

### 3. **Reddit-Style Username System**

#### What Was Implemented:
- **Unique Username Generation**: Auto-generates creative usernames like "happyPixel", "jollyRocket"
- **Clerk Integration**: Stores usernames in Clerk's `publicMetadata`
- **Forum Integration**: Displays usernames when users post non-anonymously
- **14,400 Unique Combinations**: 120 adjectives × 120 nouns

#### Files Modified:
- `server/src/models/User.js` - Added username field
- `server/src/controllers/userController.js` - Already had username generation logic
- `server/src/controllers/forumController.js` - Fetches and displays usernames from Clerk
- `Frontend/src/pages/ForumNew.tsx` - Displays username or pseudonym based on anonymous flag

#### How It Works:
1. **On User Creation**: Auto-generates unique username and stores in Clerk
2. **Forum Posts**: 
   - If anonymous: Shows generated pseudonym (e.g., "Brave Student")
   - If not anonymous: Shows user's unique username from Clerk
3. **Comments**: Same logic applies

#### Username Format:
- Pattern: `adjectiveNoun` (camelCase)
- Examples: `happyPixel`, `sparkComet`, `zenithWillow`
- Validation: Must match regex `^[a-z]+[A-Z][a-z]+$`

### 4. **Email Configuration for Bookings**

#### What Was Implemented:
- **Sender Email**: Configured to use `waypointplatform@gmail.com`
- **Reply-To Header**: Ensures replies go to correct address
- **Beautiful HTML Templates**: Professional booking confirmation emails
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if email fails

#### Files Modified:
- `server/src/utils/email.js` - Added reply-to header, ensured correct sender
- `server/src/controllers/bookingController.js` - Already had email sending logic

#### Email Features:
- ✅ Booking confirmation with session details
- 📅 Formatted date and time
- 🎨 Beautiful HTML template with WayPoint branding
