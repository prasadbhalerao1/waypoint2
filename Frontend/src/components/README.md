# components

Reusable, presentational and container components shared across the WayPoint frontend.

Each component lives in its own file and follows the **atomic design** principle (roughly molecules & organisms). All components are fully typed, responsive and accessible.

> When contributing new components keep the API minimal and export a default component unless multiple variants are required.
